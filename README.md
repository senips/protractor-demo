Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.Automatic Waiting  is a plus:You no longer need to add waits and sleeps to your test. Protractor can automatically execute the next step in your test the moment the webpage finishes pending tasks, so you donâ€™t have to worry about waiting for your test and webpage to sync.For AngularJS Apps:Protractor supports Angular-specific locator strategies, which allows you to test Angular-specific elements without any setup effort on your part.
